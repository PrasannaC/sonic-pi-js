Hacking a way of writing JavaScript and sending it to Sonic PI. Just for fun!

## What is this?
I wanted to run Sonic PI from VS Code (which I found I can do with a VS
Code extension. But I also want to write the Sonic PI code in JavaScript
(don't ask me why).

So the hacky idea is:
- Create a library which will generate the Sonic PI ruby code from node.
- Create a version of the VS Code extension which will run the node and
  send it to Sonic PI..
- Profit? :-D
